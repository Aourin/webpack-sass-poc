##Super Awesome Fish

A simple boilerplate for webpack and react.
This is under a lot of construction right now.

###Step 1 - Clone
```
clone me the way you clone things in git
```

###Step 2 - Setup

```
npm run setup
```

Running the setup will do an npm install and also move the style-repos into the node_modules to mimic
an npm style of repo dependencies.

###Step 3 - Building and Running
If you want to just build

```
npm run build
```

If you want run dev server

```
npm run dev
```

If you want to eat a sandwhich. This won't do anything though.

```
sudo eat sandwich
```
